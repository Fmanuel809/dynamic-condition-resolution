# Dynamic Condition Resolution

This TypeScript code showcases dynamic condition resolution, a technique to evaluate varying conditions in your projects. It's particularly useful when dealing with complex decision-making scenarios based on changing data.

## How It Works

The code includes an `enum` named `LogicalOperator` that represents different logical comparisons. The `evaluateSingleCondition` function takes a condition and compares it with the provided data, returning a boolean result. This approach allows you to handle diverse conditions in a structured and adaptable manner.

## Usage

1. Open the TypeScript file `src/index.ts`.
2. Modify the conditions in the `evaluateSingleCondition` function to match your use case.
3. Set up the `inputData` object with the data you want to evaluate.
4. Run the code using your preferred TypeScript compiler or runtime environment.

## Example Scenario

Suppose you're building a workflow engine, and decisions are made based on dynamic conditions, such as age, student status, country, etc. This code provides a blueprint for handling such scenarios efficiently and flexibly.

## Limitations

Keep in mind that while this code offers dynamic condition resolution, it doesn't cover every possible scenario. Adapt and expand it according to your project's specific needs.
